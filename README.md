# Turing
Turing is a wonderful first programming language, and one that I believe most people should spend at least a little bit of time with.
In this repo you will find a copy of Turing 4.1, as well as all of my own experiments and projects.
Any larger projects will be in a folder, all exercises or experiments will just be individual files.

## Turing IDE
I have uploaded a ZIP file containing Turing 4.1 and all of it's associated documentation here for archival purposes.
The original download can be found <a href="http://compsci.ca/holtsoft">here</a>.
