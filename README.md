# Turing
Turing is a wonderful first programming language, and one that I believe most people should spend at least a little bit of time with.<br>
In this repo you will find a copy of Turing 4.1, as well as all of my own experiments and projects.<br>
Any larger projects will be in a folder, all exercises or experiments will just be individual files.

### Turing IDE
I have uploaded a ZIP file containing Turing 4.1 and all of it's associated documentation here for archival purposes.<br>
The original download can be found <a href="http://compsci.ca/holtsoft">here</a>.

# Projects
### Escape from Ashfall
This is a text-based adventure game that I started making in 2023.<br>
It's something I've wanted to try since I started learning to code, and I finally started it.<br>
It will be under construction for a while.

### PassGen
A very simple password generator.<br>
Simply an experiment that I decided to chase a little further.<br>
A more feature-rich and legitimately useful version written in C# may come as a standalone project someday.
